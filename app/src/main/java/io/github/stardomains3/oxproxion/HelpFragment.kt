            *   An internet connection is required.
            *   The app is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
            *   This app is not affiliated with OpenRouter.ai.
            *   Costs are incurred with using OpenRouter models. Familiarize yourself with model costs at [https://openrouter.ai/models/](https://openrouter.ai/models/)
            *   Markdown content is well-supported in AI response chat messages.
